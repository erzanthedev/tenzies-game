## 📋 Overview

Welcome to the **Tenzies Game** project! 🎮

**Tenzies** is a fun and interactive dice game where the goal is to roll the dice until all of them show the same number. Players can select which dice to hold and which to re-roll, making it a game of both luck and strategy.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to put my React skills to the test by building an interactive game application. This project allowed me to explore and implement a variety of important React concepts and techniques, which are essential for developing dynamic and engaging user interfaces.

## 🛠️ React Concepts in Practice

Throughout the development of the Tenzies Game, I focused on the following key React concepts:

- **Reusable Custom Components**: I built modular and reusable components, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

- **Mastering JSX Syntax**: I deepened my understanding of JSX, which enables the seamless integration of HTML and JavaScript within React.

- **Organizing and Styling Components**: I organized and styled components effectively to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

- **Mapping Through Data**: I used data mapping techniques to dynamically display information, such as the dice values, in the game.

- **Refactoring Code with Props**: I passed props as objects, using spread syntax to enhance code readability and efficiency.

- **Updating Objects and Arrays**: I practiced updating objects and arrays within React state, using the spread syntax to ensure immutability and prevent unintended side effects.

- **Destructuring**: I applied destructuring techniques to simplify code and make it more concise.

- **Conditional Rendering & Ternary Statements**: I implemented conditional rendering and ternary statements to control the display of components based on the game state.

- **Event Listeners**: I used event listeners to handle user interactions, such as clicking on dice to hold or re-roll them.

- **Using State and Effects**: I managed the game’s state using React's `useState` hook and handled side effects with the `useEffect` hook.

## 🧪 Testing My React Skills

The Tenzies Game was an excellent opportunity to:

- **Apply Core React Concepts**: From building reusable components to managing state and effects, this project covered a wide range of React development techniques.
- **Improve Code Quality**: By refactoring and applying advanced JavaScript concepts, I made the codebase more efficient, readable, and maintainable.

- **Create an Engaging User Experience**: By focusing on the game's interactive elements, I was able to create an engaging and fun user experience that also looks visually appealing.
